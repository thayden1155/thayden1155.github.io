                <a>Surfing is a big part of my family's life when we are in Costa Rica. If possible, we surf everyday.
                    <br>
                It really just depends on if the waves are good or not. We typically go out in the mornings because that’s when it's best.
                    <br>
                We also love to go out and surf during sunset, it’s very beautiful and calming. It was great having my whole family out there surfing this year.
                    <br>
                Everytime two or more of us share a wave, one of us yells “party wave!”. Surfing with family and friends is always a great time!
                    <br>
                I had some of my favorite moments this summer just surfing with the family.</a></div>
