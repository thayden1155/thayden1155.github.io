                <p style="text-align:center;"> Every day my family goes down to the beach to watch the sunset. However, we wanted to take a special trip to watch the sunset somewhere else. <p>
               <p style="text-align:center;">  My sister Olivia had heard of this restaurant called Gracia Mar Vista with an infinite pool and nice view. My family thought it sounded cool so one afternoon we decided to drive there. <p>
                <p style="text-align:center;"> Once we arrived we put our belongings on the chairs, ordered some drinks, and jumped in the pool. The drinks were delicious and unique. I got a drink called the “Dirty Monkey”. <p>
                <p style="text-align:center;"> It had baileys irish cream, banana, ice cream, and some other ingredients that I can’t remember. It was very good but a little too sweet, it was almost like a shake. <p>

                <p style="text-align:center;"> My family spent about an hour just having fun in the pool and ordering drinks. The view was amazing and it continued to get better as the sun started to set. <p>
                <p style="text-align:center;"> Laura began to do her infamous handstands in the pool and other pool aerobics. This trip was very fun and I would definitely recommend this spot to anyone near the area. <p>
