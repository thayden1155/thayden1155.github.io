              <p style="text-align:center;">This past summer was very special because my whole family finally got to have a family vacation together in Costa Rica. </p>
                  
              <p style="text-align:center;">Tyler also brought his girlfriend Carlin and I brought Laura, my girlfriend. </p>
                  
              <p style="text-align:center;">For the past 7 years, Kate and Tyler havenâ€™t been able to find time to make it down to Costa Rica due to school and work. </p>
                 
              <p style="text-align:center;"> So join my family on a fun adventure in Costa Rica where we <a style="text-decoration:none" href="2ndpage.html">snorkel</a>, <a href="3rdpage.html">surf</a>, and go on <a href="4thpage.html">tropical adventures</a>. </p>
