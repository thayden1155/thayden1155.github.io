                <p style="text-align:center;"> <font size="-.5">  For the first time this summer, I went snorkeling in Costa Rica. Through all the years of us going to Costa Rica, my family has never gone on a snorkeling trip. </font> </p>
               <p style="text-align:center;"> <font size="-.5">  Everyone went on the snorkeling trip except for Tyler and my Mom. Carlin was the one that booked the boat ride out to snorkel because she loves to scuba dive. </font> </p>
               <p style="text-align:center;"> <font size="-.5">  She brought all her equipment to Costa Rica because she likes to try to scuba dive in every new place she visit. Carlin is a certified diver, she was the only one able to scuba dive while the rest of us snorkeled. </font> </p>
               <p style="text-align:center;"> <font size="-.5">  The morning of the trip we woke up around 6am to drive into town to meet up with the snorkeling and scuba company. The company told us we would be going to two different diving locations. </font></p>
               <p style="text-align:center;"> <font size="-.5">  About an hour later we drove to the beach and got onto the boat. The boat ride was about an hour long to get to the first location and it was super pretty. </font></p>

                 <div>  
                <p style="text-align:center;"> <font size="-1"> The sun was hot but the wind and small water particles flying up from the boat would cool you off. Once we got to the location, we put our gear on and dove in. </font></p>
              <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="-1"> The ocean was so refreshing, it was clear and very peaceful swimming around with the fish. However, during the first dive I didn’t see anything too amazing. I mainly just saw some fish swimming around, a starfish, and other little creatures. </font> </p> 
               <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="-1"> We were in the water for nearly 45 minutes until we swam back to the boat. Once on the boat, we made our way to the second location and were served some fruit and delicious juice. </font></p>
               <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="-1"> The second location was only about 15-20 minutes away from the first location. Once again we dove for nearly 45 minutes. However, this dive was much better than the first one. </font> </p>
               <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="-1"> I got to see multiple turtles and two sharks, which were the two sea creatures that I wanted to see. I got a little spooked by the sharks. </font></p> 
               <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="-1"> I don’t know much about sharks, so I couldn’t tell which kind they were but they weren’t very big. There were also huge schools of fishes and the bigger fish were more beautiful at this location. </font> </p>
               <p style="text-align:center;"><font size="-1"> The dive was super fun and a very cool experience. Once we got back on the boat, we headed back to land, got our car, and headed back home. </font></p>
