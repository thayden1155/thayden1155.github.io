                <p style="text-align:center;">Here’s a bit of a background story before I get into the real story of my summer in Costa Rica. I am the youngest of four children.</p>
               
                 <p style="text-align:center;">From oldest to youngest it is Kate, Tyler, Olivia, and myself the youngest. I also can’t forget about my parents Kurt and Julie.</p>
                
                 <p style="text-align:center;">My family has been going to Costa Rica ever since I was very little. I can’t remember my first summer there, I think I was around the age of 8.</p> 
               
                <p style="text-align:center;"> Anyways, my parents loved Costa Rica, so they decided to buy land there and build a house when I was about 10 years old. </p>
               
                <p style="text-align:center;"> Ever since, I’ve spent every single summer in Costa Rica.
                
                 <p style="text-align:center;">Anyways, back to the real <a style="color:#1DFFAA;text-decoration:none;" href="1stpage.html">story</a>.</p></div>
