            <div class="maintable"><a>Here’s a bit of a background story before I get into the real story of my summer in Costa Rica. My family consists of six people, my dad, my mom, Kate, who is the oldest, Tyler the middle child, Olivia the second youngest, and myself the youngest of the family. My family has been going to Costa Rica ever since I was very little. I can’t remember my first summer there, I think I was around the age of 8. Anyways, my parents loved Costa Rica, so they decided to buy land there and build a house when I was about 10 years old. Ever since, I’ve spent every single summer in Costa Rica.<a href="2ndpage.html">keyword</a> about snorkeling with another clickable link to another page</a></div>
