                <a>Here’s a bit of a background story before I get into the real story of my summer in Costa Rica.
                <br>
                I am the youngest of four children. From oldest to youngest it is Kate, Tyler, Olivia, and myself the youngest. I also can’t forget about my parents Kurt and Julie.
                <br>
                My family has been going to Costa Rica ever since I was very little. I can’t remember my first summer there, I think I was around the age of 8. 
                <br>
                Anyways, my parents loved Costa Rica, so they decided to buy land there and build a house when I was about 10 years old. 
                <br>
                Ever since, I’ve spent every single summer in Costa Rica.
                <br>
                Anyways, back to the real <a href="1stpage.html">story</a>.</a></div>
